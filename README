=============
Prerequisites
=============

- Python version 2.7.1 (only tested on this version and might run on earlier versions)
- Python Imaging Library (PIL, http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)






============
Testing sets
============
The test directory contains three directories with images having the following properties

img_set_0 : Uniform square images (icons) where the largest image is 128X128
            This will lock the width because width and height are equal.

img_set_1 : A large 980x282 banner and the images from img_set_0
            This will lock the width because its larger than any image height.

img_set_2 : A large 320x600 banner and the images from img_set_0
            This will lock the height because its larger than any image width.
